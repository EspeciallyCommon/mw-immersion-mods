## More Dangerous Blight Diseases
- [**Better Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48395) by Cognatogen  
Changes the effects of Blight Diseases to make them more interesting and unique, rather than just more potent versions of the common diseases.  

## More Dangerous Blight Storms
- [**Blighted Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48631) by Necrolesian  
A MWSE-lua implementation of Half11's [**Blight Storms Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45558). Travelling in a blight storm now carries a risk of infection. Because it's implemented in lua, it will also take into account any mod-added blight diseases.
- [**Diseases Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45228) by Half11  
Not blight related, but a close cousin: Creatures now carry a wider variety of diseases. These are diseases that were in the vanilla game but not assigned to creatures.  
- [**Creeping Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47904) by Necrolesian  
Blight storms start appearing in regions outside Red Mountain as the main quest progresses, or as time passes. Also comes with base weather tweaks that enables a chance of ash storms outside the ashlands. Comes with a MWSE-lua version (recommended) or a plugin version.  
- [**Bad Weather Matters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46495?tab=description) by Ian  
Travelling in inclement weather now inflicts penalties, including ash and blight storms.

## Blight Affects Creatures Too

- [**Blighted Mines Mean Blighted Workers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/33920) by Gavrilo93  
Workers standing outside blighted mines will also be blighted.  
- [**No Disease Labels**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48295) by RedFurryDemon  
You can no longer tell from the label whether an animal is blighted or not. Beware!  
- [**Blight is Coming**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47649) by Half11   
Corprus creatures will spawn behind you in blight storms, making it far more dangerous to travel in a blight storm -- especially if you use this together with Beware the Sixth House.   
- [**Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by Mort   
This is a rebalance mod that makes the 6th House and corprus creatures truly something to be feared. It's designed to be used together with its sibling mods [**Tribunal Rebalance**]() and [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](). Mournhold and Solstheim are now areas that lower-level characters can visit if they're careful, while the 6th House become truly terrifying endgame foes. Do not venture onto the slopes of Red Mountain unprepared!
- [**Dreamers Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42990) by Aoimhevelho  
Adds a variety of new Dreamer enemies for you to face, from well-armored warriors to pitiful Dreamers clothed in rags and corprus sores.
- [**Corprus Natives**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674) by rot  
Corprus Stalker and Lame Corprus textures are replaced with Dunmer equivalents.

## Protect Yourself
![Improved Inns - AST Arrille's Attic](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/36017-1-1292084856.jpg)

- [**Find Shelter MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48583) by Stripes  
Resting outside is disabled in bad weather, further disincentivising travel.  
- [**Improved Inns Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48610) by RandomPal  
This mod merges Improved Inns and The Publicans as well as AST Arrille Attic, extends the Improved Inns functionality to TR inns, and adds compatibility with Entertainers Expanded/Entertainers Expanded Again. All the better to wait out the storms in!
- [**Protective Masks Redux**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by Half11  
Certain helmets have been added to leveled lists that will provide protection against blight and common diseases.   

## Find Healing
- [**Religions Elaborated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47843) by Caeris 
Among its other features, adds healers who will cure you for a fee. Not compatible with Raejak's Healers.  
- [**Descriptive Shrines - Healing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46119) by SuperQuail  
Shrine blessings will now tell you what they do before you accept the blessing, and asking for healing is now an option.
