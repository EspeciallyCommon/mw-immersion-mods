# The Modded Blight Experience on Vvardenfell

![Creeping Blight Blight in Aldruhn](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/47904/47904-1588318090-1695244591.png)

So much of Morrowind's atmosphere comes from the creeping threat of the Blight: ash storms, rumours of corprus beasts escaping the confines of the Ghostfence, attacks on Imperial patrols, Divayth Fyr's Corprusarium, Ashlanders struggling to treat tribesmen who fall ill, economic stability and food security put at risk by blighted egg mines, it goes on and on. And walking out onto the slopes of Red Mountain, with the blight clouds rapidly descending and bringing visibility to almost nothing, it certainly feels atmospheric.  

But unfortunately, in vanilla the blight storms are just that: atmospheric. They're not dangerous. Thankfully, that's what we have mods for. 

NOTE: This list assumes that you're using MGE XE and MWSE-lua: there are mwscript alternatives compatible with OpenMW for some of these mods, but not all of them.
NOTE2: images in this article courtesy of some of the mods listed below (Creeping Blight, Corprus Natives, Improved Inns Expanded: AST Arrille's Attic Addon)

## More Dangerous Blight Diseases
- [**Better Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48395) by Cognatogen  
Changes the effects of Blight Diseases to make them more interesting and unique, rather than just more potent versions of the common diseases.  

## More Dangerous (and atmospheric) Blight Storms
- [**Blighted Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48631) by Necrolesian  
A MWSE-lua implementation of Half11's [**Blight Storms Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45558). Travelling in a blight storm now carries a risk of infection. Because it's implemented in lua, it will also take into account any mod-added blight diseases.
- [**Diseases Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45228) by Half11  
Not blight related, but a close cousin: Creatures now carry a wider variety of diseases. These are diseases that were in the vanilla game but not assigned to creatures.  
- [**Creeping Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47904) by Necrolesian  
Blight storms start appearing in regions outside Red Mountain as the main quest progresses, or as time passes. Also comes with base weather tweaks that enables a chance of ash storms outside the ashlands. Comes with a MWSE-lua version (recommended) or a plugin version.  
- [**Bad Weather Matters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46495?tab=description) by Ian  
Travelling in inclement weather now inflicts penalties, including ash and blight storms.  
- [**Heartthrum**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47178) by RedFurryDemon  
It doesn't make blight storms more dangerous per se, but it certainly makes the walk up Red Mountain *feel* momentous. You can now hear the Heart of Lorkhan as you approach the crater citadels.  
- [**Shattered Stones - an Earthquake Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) by R-zero and Greatness7  
Some areas of Vvardenfell now have occasional earthquakes, which will shake your screen, cause dust to appear if you're inside, and sometimes make you or NPCs around you stumble and fall. Limited to Molag Amur region, unfortunately, but still very atmospheric!  
- [**Ashfall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057) by Merlord  
Ashfall is the most fully featured survival and needs management mod available for Morrowind. Between making sure that you have enough supplies to survive a trek through the wilderness, and the punishing effects of being caught out in bad weather without the right equipment, Ashfall makes blight storms - and even regular ash and rain storms - something every traveller needs to worry about.  
Ashfall includes a catch-blight-from-storms mechanic, so you don't need to use Blighted Blight or Blight Storms Restored alongside it.

## Blight Doesn't Just Affect You
![Corprus Natives](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/45674/45674-1526611451-1056904407.jpeg)

- [**Blighted Mines Mean Blighted Workers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/33920) by Gavrilo93  
Workers standing outside blighted mines will also be blighted.  
- [**No Disease Labels**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48295) by RedFurryDemon  
You can no longer tell from the label whether an animal is blighted or not. Beware!  
- [**Blight is Coming**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47649) by Half11   
Corprus creatures will spawn behind you in blight storms, making it far more dangerous to travel in a blight storm -- especially if you use this together with Beware the Sixth House.   
- [**Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by Mort   
This is a rebalance mod that makes the 6th House and corprus creatures truly something to be feared. It's designed to be used together with its sibling mods [**Tribunal Rebalance**]() and [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](). Mournhold and Solstheim are now areas that lower-level characters can visit if they're careful, while the 6th House become truly terrifying endgame foes. Do not venture onto the slopes of Red Mountain unprepared!
- [**Dreamers Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42990) by Aoimhevelho  
Adds a variety of new Dreamer enemies for you to face, from well-armored warriors to pitiful Dreamers clothed in rags and corprus sores.
- [**Corprus Natives**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674) by rot  
Corprus Stalker and Lame Corprus textures are replaced with Dunmer equivalents.  
- [**Wear A Mask**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49240) by Von Djangos  
Some NPCs in ashstorm-prone towns (Ald-ruhn, Maar Gan, Molag Mar) will equip masks when it starts to storm.

## Protect Yourself and Others
![Improved Inns - AST Arrille's Attic](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/36017-1-1292084856.jpg)

- [**Find Shelter MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48583) by Stripes  
Resting outside is disabled in bad weather, further disincentivising travel.  
- [**Improved Inns Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48610) by RandomPal  
This mod merges Improved Inns and The Publicans as well as AST Arrille Attic, extends the Improved Inns functionality to TR inns, and adds compatibility with Entertainers Expanded/Entertainers Expanded Again. All the better to wait out the storms in!
- [**Protective Masks Redux**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by Half11  
Certain helmets have been added to leveled lists that will provide protection against blight and common diseases.   
- [**Quarantined Vvardenfell**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47335) by Gavrilo93  
Asciene Rane will no longer allow you to travel to the mainland if you have a blight, common, or corprus disease. Go get cured before you spread your infection!  

## Find Healing
- [**Religions Elaborated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47843) by Caeris 
Among its other features, adds healers who will cure you for a fee. Not compatible with Raejak's Healers.  
- [**Descriptive Shrines - Healing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46119) by SuperQuail  
Shrine blessings will now tell you what they do before you accept the blessing, and asking for healing is now an option.  
- [**Blight at the Hairat-Vassami Egg Mine**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47589) by Gavrilo93  
In Maar Gan, there is a note about a fallen Redoran warrior who died trying to cure a blighted egg mine. In vanilla, nothing further happens: in this mod, you are offered the opportunity to complete the warrior's quest and cure the egg mine. If you do, miners will return to work at the mine. You don't need to be a member of House Redoran to complete the quest.
