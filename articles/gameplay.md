* [**Realistic Sun Damage**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47540) by OperatorJack  
This mod adds a +/- 50% random modifier to the sun damage calculation. It doesn't make sense that sun damage is a constant value for the given time and weather, as clouds and coverage can change. It does not modify the sun damage formula in any other way. So, for example, if the vanilla sun damage calculation returns 4, the new calculation could return 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

* [**Weapon Sheathing Additions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49616) by Remiros  
Adds sheaths to weapons that previously didn't have any  
* [**Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599) by Stuporstar and Greatness7  
Now works with OpenMW! MWSE Graphic Herbalism harnesses the power of lua and mesh switchnodes, allowing this mod to be run without an esp or standard scripts.

* [**Protective Helmets**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50280) by Virnetch  
Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet. This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms. Inspired by Protective Masks originally by WanderRA, and rereleased by Half11. The effects behave in the same way as a constant enchantment, but are added when equipping the item instead of editing the original object, thus being compatible with enchanted items.
* [**Fashionwind - Glasses and Goggles**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50448) by Safebox and RuffinVangarr  
This mod adds glasses and goggles with an MWSE script that allows them to be worn without hiding your hair or even taking up the helmet slot. (requires onion layers mod)

* [**Magicka-Based Skill Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330) by JaceyS  
Spell casting skills advance based on the amount of Magicka spent, rather than the number of spell casts.

Casting the magelight on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell.  
* [**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Invisibility**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565) by OperatorJack, Kurpulio & Vtastek  
Using invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Also, under the effect of invisibility, Daedra and undead creatures will seem... different.
* [**Mabo's Foundations**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47244) by Meta Barj0  
Not a mod per se, but a framework that is necessary for other MAB0's mods to work
* [**Mabo's Manipulated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47222) by Meta Barj0  
This mod makes all mental manipulation effect count as an aggression. Player will be fine if witnessed using one of these effects.

* [**The Levitation Act**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47345) by OperatorJack and Alice93  
"3E 421 — The Levitation Act is passed throughout the Empire, outlawing the use of levitation magic."  
This mod makes it so that performing a levitation spell is illegal, as it is supposed to be according to The Levitation Act. Performing a levitation spell or using a levitation enchantment and being caught while doing so will give you a bounty of 500 gold per levitation effect, per cast! However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a levitation spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone. This functionality does not apply to NPCs and creatures.
* [**Wings of Will**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626) by sataniel  
In the base game, the levitation speed is based on the Speed attribute. This never made much sense to me. You can levitate faster by being a great runner? Now levitation is based on the Willpower attribute (just as the Alteration skill is) with other calculations remaining the same.

Adds a new poison mechanic similar to Oblivion and Skyrim's. NPCs can use poison as well! Also allows you to use apparatus in-world rather than having to pick it up and use it from your inventory, and a new alchemy mode where better apparatus decreases positive effects rather than negative so you can craft your own poisons.  
* [**Go Fletch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46752) by Merlord

Equipping these in a tavern after 6pm will allow you to perform any one of 10 pieces, during which you will earn gold. You can also perform music when outdoors, which provides a buff to fatigue recovery.

## Combat
* [**Nimble Armour**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251) by VitruvianGuar  
MWSE-lua mod which makes armor contribute to player and npcs evasion modifier as well as allows evading attacks to practice unarmored and light armor skills.

* [**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack  
This mod uses MWSE Lua to modify movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important. These changes automatically apply to the player and any NPCs / Creatures (modded or vanilla) without using a plugin or altering your savegame.  
* [**Dynamic Difficulty**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45710) by NullCascade  
Configurable difficulty. You can change the base difficulty, make the game harder or easier as you level up, or set the difficulty per region (so you could make the Bitter Coast very easy but the Ashlands much more dangerous, for example).  
* [**Diligent Defenders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45717) by NullCascade  
When combat begins, your companions will start to defend you immediately, instead of waiting for you to be attacked first. A real lifesaver if that enemy is going to kill you in one hit and you can't afford to wait!

Do more damage when stabbing an enemy from behind (NPCs can also backstab - beware turning your back!).

## Creatures
* [**The Guar Whisperer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48247) by Merlord  
A strong contestant for the best mod ever made, right up there with Expeditious Exit. Allows you to tame and breed guars, and keep them as companions.

If you've ever wanted to be able to feed Morrowind's diverse array of critters rather than having to murder them, this is the mod for you. Feedbag is for the pacifist animal-lovers. (Especially those with a Kirkbride-esque appreciation of big bugs.)
* [**WulfLib**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50339) by Duskwulf

* [**Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by Mort  
Suite of rebalance mods that make the Sixth House truly fearsome and main-quest worthy, while significantly nerfing expansion enemies (eg wolves) who shouldn't be as strong as they are.  
* [**Sepulchural Curses**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48332) by inpv  
Makes robbing tombs harder by adding a chance of summoning a random angry undead while opening a chest/urn. A pluginless MWSE solution.

Pluginless *and* assetless no-glow. Use less memory, get some frames back, and be more compatible!
* [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by Mort  
Alcohol is far too common to have effects 5x that of some potions. Why even make strength potions when sujamma costs 30g and gives you +50 hulk strength? This changes that. 
* [**Worth Its Weight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48070) by JaceyS  
Adds configurable weight to gold. By implementing gold weight using MWSE Lua, this mod works reliably without the need for dummy items or burden spell effects. It is also able to show the weight of a stack of gold in the tooltip.

## Misc
* [**Easy Escort**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712) by NullCascade
