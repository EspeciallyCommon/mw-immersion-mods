# Alternate Chargen Mods
Make the experience of starting a new game far more interesting.  

# UI Changes or Gameplay Additions 
These don't conflict with any of the below, so you can use them alongside your chargen mod of choice.  

[**MWSE Random Character Name Generator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46189) by Aleister  
Adds a random name generator to the chargen name selection UI. **Lucevar's note**: imo it fits in really well and the names it generates are very lore appropriate. As a MWSE mod it also doesn't take up any esp slots. If you've ever thought that thinking of a name is the most difficult part of chargen, I highly recommend this mod.  

[**Merlords Character Backgrounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) by Merlord  
After chargen (vanilla or modded) ends, this mod adds an extra step: choose your character's background. Some are simple stat boosts/maluses, others add scripted events such as challengers seeking to challenge a Famed Warrior or the Framed background which boosts your stealth skills at the cost of sometimes finding yourself with a bounty on your head. It really adds an interesting extra dimension to character generation.  

# Minimalist
Just get a game started more quickly - perfect for testing mods or just skipping the tutorial messages.  

[**Fresh Start**](https://stuporstar.sarahdimento.com/updates/downloads/) by Stuporstar  
Starts you off in Seyda Neen just in front of Fargoth, skipping all the tutorial. If you want to start the main quest you can find a body with the packages for Caius in the river near Balmora.  

[**QuickChar**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364) by Bink and Maximus  
Gives you the option to go through the regular tutorial sequence or to quickstart, which drops you in front of Captain Sellus Gravius to get your disbursal package.  

[**Skip Tutorial**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-5610) by cdcooley  
Gets rid of the tutorial messages and speeds up the chargen npcs, or alternatively starts you off at the door of the Census and Excise Office with Fargoth's ring and 300 gold (to save you having to loot everything).  

# Classes
[**Class Conscious**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46902) by Petethegoat  
Disables custom classes - either pick an existing playable class (including playable classes added by mods) or go through the quiz.  

[**Playable NPC Classes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43428/) by Atrayonis  
Adds the npc classes from Tamriel Data as playable classes.  

# New Starting Options
[**Personal Effects**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45338) by R-Zero  
If you start as one of the vanilla classes, gain items based on your class instead of the vanilla 87 gold.  

[**Chargen Revamped v2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44110) by Mitokandria  
[**Chargen Revamped - Expanded Lands**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44615) by Texafornian  
An updated and expanded Chargen Revamped that lets you customise your attributes, skills, starting items, and starting location. Includes locations in Tamriel Rebuilt, Province: Cyrodiil, and Skyrim Home of the Nords as well as places on Vvardenfell and Solstheim. Also includes options to start with a companion, as a vampire or werewolf, or even to go through the vanilla chargen sequence.  
**Lucevar's note**: This is the chargen mod that sets the standard for the rest. Unless you specifically want one of the themed chargens, something geared to mod testing, or something lightweight, this is probably the mod you're looking for. It covers most scenarios.  

[**Comprehensive Chargen**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-11464) by Shade the Bandit  

[**Firewatch Character Creation**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45910) by wiz1  
Starts you off in the mainland city of Firewatch. Requires Tamriel Rebuilt. 

# Themed Chargen
[**Royal Chargen**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download--7212) by Princess Stomper  
Play as Helseth's illegitimate child, about to be banished from Mournhold for an offence you may or may not have committed. Includes unique dialogue for Helseth, Barenziah and a number of other NPCs. Also includes an expansion to the Royal Palace, with a room for the player when their family accepts them again (by helping Helseth during the Tribunal quest line.) Julan Ashlander Companion has unique dialogue for players using this mod.  

[**Solstheim Begin**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39836/?) by Midgetalien  
Start off in Solstheim, having been rescued from a shipwreck by a hermit. He has a few quests for you once you're recovered from your ordeal.  

[**The Tempest**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46260) by Team Purist Pariahs  
You've been shipwrecked on an island, and must find your way off.  

# Seyda Neen Chargen - Atmosphere Tweaks
This section contains chargen mods that keep the Seyda Neen start but tweak the atmosphere in some way, from starting you off at night to match the dream or making the census and excise experience more interesting.  

[**Silent Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/14890)  
The vanilla chargen sequence, but without pauses or tutorial messages. Also edits Sellus Gravius's dialogue so you don't have to click through several topics to get all the information and items you need.  

[**Immersive Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22921) by Qebensenuf  
Significantly overhauls the Seyda Neen chargen experience, with a gritty redesign of the prison boat and Census and Excise office, new npcs with unique dialogue, scripted events, and choices for the player to make.  

[**Chargen at Night**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-80-10934) by Xeth-Ban  
Chargen starts at night during a thunderstorm. Makes a surprising amount of difference to the atmosphere!  

[**Chargen Revisited**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45510) by Zobator  
Overhauls the census and excise office

[**Improved Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/29817) by InariKettu  
A mod designed for testing other mods - start off at any level up to level 50 with appropriate equipment and spells.  

[**Simple Alternate Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43386) by At_hatoor  
Gives the player the option to start in six different cities.  

[**Better Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43995) by helswake  
Similar to Immersive Chargen but much less drastic. Gets rid of the tutorials, redesigns the census and excise office to be more office like and to prevent theft, and sets the start time to night.
