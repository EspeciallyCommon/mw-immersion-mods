* [**Quest Tweaks & Alternatives 1.19**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ihtlpfrzfhiwxo/QTA_1.19.7z?dl=0) by Stuporstar   
-- Removes quests from greetings to make them less pushy.    
-- Iulus Truptor is now more ridiculous. Failing his quests now cut off his other quests though, but you get lots of second chances if you can resist the urge to tell him off. You might want to save before talking to him. Also you get one chance to lip him off at the start, but it will affect how he reacts to you being an ass to him later.  
-- Added checks that allow for gathering donations with an average disposition if speechcraft is 80 or higher

#### Missing Limeware
* [**Quest Tweaks & Alternatives 1.19**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ihtlpfrzfhiwxo/QTA_1.19.7z?dl=0) by Stuporstar  
-- Kaye will recognize if you're a High Elf while talking about Caryarel.  
-- Filtered Caryarel dialogue properly so the IC quest can't be accidentally started if you know the topic Caryarel. 
-- Added an extra goody-two-shoes option to pay Almse Arenim Caryarel's overdue rent to get a key to his shack. If your disposition is above 80, she'll just give it to you.  
-- If you paid Caryarel's rent and ask him again about the Chapel Limeware Bowl before turning it in, you can make him admit to the theft and promise to mend his ways. This gives you a disposition boost with several NPCs: Caryarel, Almse Arenim, and Kaye.  
#### The Haunting
