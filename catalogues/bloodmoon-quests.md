# Bloodmoon Main Quest
#### An Island to the North

This mod makes changes to a few dialogue lines, giving them more specific speaker conditions and slightly altering their quest stage results, so that you won't get any journal entry unless you actually ask about Solstheim.  
-- Go see Caius Cosades and ask him about latest rumors. You get no journal update, but Solstheim topic becomes available. You can now ask him about it, and get journal updates.  
-- Just go straight to Khuul and ask around about latest rumors. You get no journal update, but Solstheim topic becomes available. Now ask some more, you will get journal updates and directions to S'virr.

-- No Solstheim rumours until PCLevel >= 6. You can still travel to Solstheim straight away if you want.  
-- Only one (random) non-Legion Imperial has his son sent to Solstheim.  
-- Binds the other rumour ("I heard there...north of Vvardenfell.") to the Agent class. This was done to prevent every NPC from having the Solstheim topic.  
-- If the player somehow missed the second quest update (BM_Rumors 50) after hearing about Solstheim for the first time (BM_Rumors 10); Scouts can also update your journal ("That's the frozen...transportation in Khuul.")  
-- The permanent topic about getting to Solstheim is also tied to the Scout class now ("A terrible place...any reason to go.")  
-- Louis Beauchamp (NPC outside Ald'ruhn Mages Guild) will be disabled until you started the Bloodmoon main quest. This was done to prevent new players from getting spoiled by his quest; sending them to Solstheim.
