Expands on the Mages Guild/Telvanni rivalry.
** Added alternate dialogue to Ranis Athrys if the player is Telvanni. She'll give you a harder time than anyone else, but won't totally oppose you -- she wants to convert "your kind" to the guild after all.
** Ranis Athrys won't talk to you after you become Archmagister of the Telvanni, and she'll attack you if you become both Archmagister and Arch-Mage.
** Joining the Mages Guild after becoming Archmagister of the Telvanni will give you the starting rank of Evoker. Ranis won't let you join or give you duties. 
** Trebonius will assume your joking if you ask him to join as Archmagister, but he won't refuse you quests afterwards. 
** Ajira's dialogue is slightly different if you're a high-ranking Telvanni, and she won't ask you to fetch a bowl (though you can do the rest).
** You have to kill Trebonius to become Arch-Mage if you're Telvanni.

#### A Wizard's Staff
#### Arch-Mage
#### I'm NOT a Necromancer!

## Ajira's Quests, Balmora Guild

** Ajira's quests give slightly better rewards.
** Adds alternate quest path to help Galbedir instead of Ajira
** Early faction reputation gains (from Ajira's and Galbedir's quests) have been made smaller, because it doesn't make sense to be able to shoot up to Evoker by doing quests that barely get them up to Journeymen.
** The other NPCs in the Balmora Mages Guild have been given more to say about the rivalry to help the player decide who they'd rather help when they're both acting like jerks.

If you spare Tashpi Ashibael, ownership will be removed from the items in her hut in Mar Gaan, meaning you can use it as a player house after she disappears. This won't happen if you kill her.
#### Catch a Spy

Many changes for Telvanni players: 
** You can't get this quest if you're too high-ranking in the Telvanni by the time you talk to Ranis Athrys. Instead, she'll attack you.
** If you got the quest and didn't finish it before becoming Archmagister, it plays out a bit differently, and assumes you're out to find the spy to help discredit Ranis.
** If you're Telvanni, people will be unhelpful, and perhaps even suspicious. Trebonius remains relatively oblivious. 
** If you're Archmagister, most people won't talk to you about this, and Trebonius assumes you're threatening him.
** Tiram Gadar will give you a reward for turning in Ranis if you're Telvanni. Trebonius will do it if you're not Telvanni.

** You can now talk Sirilonwe into giving you Chimarvamidium, and buy it from her later if your disposition is really high.
** Edwinna's dialogue makes a check to see if you haven't stolen Chimarvamidium, yet somehow acquired a copy through random loot tables or mods.

* [**Quest Tweaks & Alternatives 1.19**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ihtlpfrzfhiwxo/QTA_1.19.7z?dl=0) by Stuporstar  
** Tenyeminwe now gives you the scrolls as soon as the escort is done instead of having to talk to her again.
** Tenyeminwe also has more dialogue regarding her Telvanni problems, with slighty more if you happen to be Telvanni.

If you're Telvanni, you still have to option to take the quest, but threatening him will make him challenge you to a duel and bump you into taking his place as Arch-Mage. Only available if you've become Archmagister of the Telvanni.
