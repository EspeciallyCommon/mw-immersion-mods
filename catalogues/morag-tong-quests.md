** Non-hostile NPCs that had no indication that they carried Sanguine items now either have small quests or challenges. Mehrunes Razor is required as a "Sanguine indicator" -- that is, these NPCs won't reveal they have Sanguine items unless you're carrying the Razor, because most of them are Dark Brotherhood/Mehrunes Dagon worshipers.
