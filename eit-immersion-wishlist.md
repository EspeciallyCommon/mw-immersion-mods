## Take shelter you fool
- Ashfall by Merlord

- [**Something's Not Right**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46497) by Cliffworms -- text-based, immersive warnings outside of dangerous places.  
- [**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632) by Merlord -- now you can no longer sleep in owned beds, unless the owner really likes you... or is deceased.  
- [**Limited Intervention**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46687) by Merlord -- why would gods you don't believe in help you out? Intervention spells are now limited by your rank in the Tribunal Temple or Imperial Cult. Scrolls and Enchantments are unaffected.  
- [**Camonna Tong's Violence**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-55-6173) by Arcimaestro Antares -- NPCs in the Balmora Council Club will now attack you if their disposition is too low. If you're foolhardy enough to rent a bed there, they may rob you in your sleep or try to kill you.

- [**Realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673) by Merlord -- equipment you loot from enemies will be damaged, and you'll have to repair it before it's useful - or valuable.

- [**Enchantment Services**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554) -- npc enchanters can now recharge enchanting items, create additional copies of scrolls, or decipher a scroll so that you can use the spell it contains. For a price, naturally.  
- [**Better Enchantments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47136) by Aracelliy -- this is a bit of a controversial one. Changes the feel of enchanted items by converting a large number of cast on use enchantments to constant effect.  
- [**Magicka Enhanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111) by OperatorJack and RedFurryDemon -- adds a vast number of spells and spell tomes. A requirement of the MM series and many other mods.

- [**Pursuit Revisited**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45904) by Svengineer -- Enemies will now follow you through load doors, based on a number of sensible AI calculations (animals can't open doors, vampires won't follow you outside unless it's night, etc). Guards will come inside if an NPC calls the alarm. There's a delay based on distance. NPCs will eventually go back to their original positions. You can now yield to guards.

- [**Realistic Healing and Injuries**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47084) by Aracelliy -- you can now incur injuries in combat that you must rest to heal. Pairs well with mods like Bed Buddies and No Rest Without A Bed that make resting more difficult.
