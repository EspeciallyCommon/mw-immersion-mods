# The Everything Is Terrible Wishlist of Dreams

## Oops You Screwed Up - Consequences for skill failure  
- Armorer: Damage or (rarely) destroy armor you attempt to repair, if your armorer skill is very low.  
- Enchant: Chance that a soulwraith appears and attacks you if you fail to enchant or recharge an item.  
- Alchemy: Chance to be poisoned by noxious fumes if you fail to create a potion or poison.  
- Security: Chance to set off a trap if you fail a probe attempt. Chance to jam a lock if you fail a lockpick attempt, causing the lock value to go up.

## Plague Inc - Disease Mechanics

- Healers actually heal you (for a price)  
- Being in blight/ash storms carries a risk of blight
