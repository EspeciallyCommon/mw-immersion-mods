[**MGE XE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) by Hrnchamd & MGE Team   
Make sure to get [**DirectX 9.0c**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) as well - yes, future me reading this, it does have to be THIS version of DirectX. MWSE is included in this installer. Make sure to run MWSE-update.exe.

[**FNVulkan - Performance Boost using DXVK**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73800) by gingerdeadshot  
It was made for FNV but it works for Morrowind too! If you have a graphics card that supports Vulkan, you'll probably see a hefty FPS boost if you use this. Results may vary though. Personally I get 10-15 extra FPS in Vivec, Temple, which is traditionally one of the laggiest parts of my game.  

## Utilities for Mod-Makers
[**TES3 Construction Set**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196) by Bethesda  
The Construction Set for Steam users, since Steam doesn't include the CS in its download.  
[**Quick Char**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364) by Bink & Maximus  
For quicker mod testing.  
[**Cheat Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47143) by qqqbbb  
For even quicker and more advanced mod testing.

# Bug Fixes
[**Patch for Purists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096?) by Half11  
[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Speaking of life-saving mods, this one fixes a bug where Morrowind will often hang when you try to exit the game (or when you CTD). This will save you a LOT of time.  
[**Memory Monitor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696) by NullCascade  
This simple mod provides an in-game HUD element as the game approaches critical memory limits. At a critical threshold, it can prompt to save and quit.
