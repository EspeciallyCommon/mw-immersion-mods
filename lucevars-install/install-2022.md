Make sure to get [**DirectX 9.0c**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) as well - yes, future me reading this, it does have to be THIS version of DirectX. MWSE is included in this installer. Make sure to run MWSE-update.exe.

[**FNVulkan - Performance Boost using DXVK**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73800) by gingerdeadshot  
It was made for FNV but it works for Morrowind too! If you have a graphics card that supports Vulkan, you'll probably see a hefty FPS boost if you use this. Results may vary though. Personally I get 10-15 extra FPS in Vivec, Temple, which is traditionally one of the laggiest parts of my game.  

## Utilities for Mod-Makers
[**TES3 Construction Set**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196) by Bethesda  
The Construction Set for Steam users, since Steam doesn't include the CS in its download.
