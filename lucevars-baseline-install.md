# Lucevar's Baseline Install
**Updated:** September 24th 2020

A list of mods that I personally use for every game, listed here so that I don't miss anything when I inevitably screw up my install and have to redo everything.

These are listed in roughly the order you should install them.

## Essential 3rd Party Utilities
[**Morrowind Code Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510) by Hrnchamd  
[**MGE XE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) by Hrnchamd & MGE Team   
Make sure to get [**DirectX 9.0c**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) as well - yes, future me reading this, it does have to be THIS version of DirectX. MWSE is included in this installer. Make sure to run MWSE-update.exe.    
[**Wrye Mash (Polemos Fork) 2018**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439) by Polemos & Wrye  

## Utilities for Mod-Makers
[**TES3 Construction Set**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196) by Bethesda  
The Construction Set for Steam users, since Steam doesn't include the CS in its download.  
[**Quick Char**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364) by Bink & Maximus  
For quicker mod testing.  
[**Cheat Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47143) by qqqbbb  
For even quicker and more advanced mod testing.

# General Gameplay
## UI Improvements
[**Better Dialogue Font**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36873) by Hrnchamd  
[**UI Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071) by NullCascade    
[**Better Questlist**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48272) by Virnetch  
[**Right Click Menu Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48458) by Merlord  
[**Consistent Keys**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47954) by Necrolesian  

## Music  
[**MUSE 2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46200) by Rytelier  
Delete the default config files in MWSE\config\MS, along with any empty music directories in music\MS, to avoid confusion later.  
[**Better Music System - MUSE Version**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48665) by Necrolesian  
This page has several performance related tweaks - make sure to carry these changes over when reinstalling  

# Bug Fixes
[**Patch for Purists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096?) by Half11  
[**Sheep-No-More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45168) by McChuggernaut  
Gets rid of an obnoxious sheep's baa sound effect that plays in the Ashlands.  
[**Fix those bastard rope fences**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45741) by Petethegoat and EJ12  
This colourfully named mod fixes player animations and rope meshes so that you get stuck much, much less often. It's an absolute lifesaver of a mod.  
[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Speaking of life-saving mods, this one fixes a bug where Morrowind will often hang when you try to exit the game (or when you CTD). This will save you a LOT of time.  
[**Memory Monitor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696) by NullCascade  
This simple mod provides an in-game HUD element as the game approaches critical memory limits. At a critical threshold, it can prompt to save and quit.  

## Performance Tweaks
[**Morrowind Optimisation Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384) by Greatness7 and Remiros  
[**Project Atlas**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) by Project Atlas Team  

## Balance Fixes
[**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros  
Balances a lot of content that was way out of line of the game's overall balance curve, and removes a lot of easy exploits.  
[**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort  
[**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort  
[**Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by mort  
[**MDMD - More Deadly Morrowind Denizens**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48745) by AutumnBramble  
[**Harter Barter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46188) by mort  
[**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort  
Mort's suite of balance mods make the expansions actually playable without hyper-efficient min-maxing or an extremely late-game character. It's no longer instant death for a sub-lvl30 character to walk around on Solstheim. The main questlines of the expansions are still tough. Beware the Sixth House rebalances the main quest so that Dagoth Ur and his minions are the game's most difficult challenge - as it should be. MDMD is a rebalance mod for NPCs, made to work alongside Mort's rebalances.
