Set of balance tweaks / overhauls. Built around MWSE-lua (and therefore *incredibly* incompatible with OpenMW). Does not attempt to be comprehensive - this is roughly the setup I use for my own playthroughs. Several of these mods have equally good alternatives available.

# Leveling
* [**Class-Conscious Character Progression CCCP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110) by Necrolesian  
This mod uses MWSE-lua to implement most of GCD's features in a simpler and more performance-friendly way.
* [**Quest Skill Reward Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48269) by Merzasphor  
This mod makes the game treat skill increases from quests as if there were raised via normal means.
* [**Magicka Based Skill Progression -- MWSE-Lua Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330) by JaceyS  
Spell casting skills advance based on the amount of Magicka spent, rather than the number of spell casts.

# Economy
* [**Harder Barter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46188) by Mort  
Dynamically adjusts how much merchants will pay for items. Pluginless, compatible with everything.  
* [**Worth Its Weight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48070) by JaceyS  
Adds configurable weight to gold. By implementing gold weight using MWSE Lua, this mod works reliably without the need for dummy items or burden spell effects. It is also able to show the weight of a stack of gold in the tooltip.

# Ownership
* [**Ownership Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48051) by Necrolesian  
This mod assigns ownership to the many, many items and containers in Morrowind that rightly should be owned but weren't, and otherwise cleans up and adjusts item ownership.  
**Compatibility Note:** Needs to have the Solstheim changes removed or patched to be compatible with HotV Solstheim.  
* [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros  
This mod attempts to fix the most glaring exploits and balance issues in the game in the most sensible way. It's supposed to be an addendum to other great balance mod like Mort's rebalances. Commonly Used Containers Nerfed, Container Ownership and Rarer Scrap Metalï»¿ by Half11 have been incorporated into this mod.
* [**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632) by Merlord  
Bed Buddies prevents you from sleeping in owned beds unless the owner really likes you. Disposition requirement is based on your Personality. Attempting to sleep in an owned bed no longer triggers a crime, even if the owner doesn't like you.
* [**Misc Mates**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48122) by Merlord  
NPCs will allow you to take small inexpensive items if their disposition towards you is high enough. The disposition required is based on the gold value of the item and the player's personality.

# Enemies
* [**Mort's Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by Mort  
Makes the Sixth House, properly, the most difficult content in the game. Assaulting Red Mountain is now properly end-game stuff, unlike vanilla where ash vampires are overshadowed by wolves. In addition, killing ash vampires now weakens Dagoth Ur, as it should. 
* [**Mort's Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by Mort  
This mod is intended to rebalance the Tribunal expansion in a variety of ways, most importantly by editing the stats of creatures and npcs.
This mod rebalances Tribunal as if it shipped with Morrowind. Recommended levels: 5-30
* [**Mort's Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by Mort  
This mod is intended to rebalance the Bloodmoon expansion in a variety of ways, most importantly by editing the stats of creatures and npcs.
This mod rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind. Recommended levels: 5-30. 
* [**More Dangerous Morrowind Denizens**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48745) by AutumnBramble  
230+ NPCs are given unique spells, enchantments, and items, to make Morrowind deadlier AND more varied. Faction bosses, Artifact owners, and Daedric cultists have been given customized, flavorful make-overs to become more difficult AND more memorable. Players are encouraged to carry resists, dispels, restores, and prepare ahead for big fights. Designed to work alongside Mort's overhauls.

# Equipment
* [**Clothing Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47813) by Necrolesian  
Implements level requirements to equip all of Morrowind's clothing items. Also includes an edited version of Remiros' [Equipment Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45980)  

# Magic
* [**Better Enchantments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47136) by Aracelliy  
Improves many enchants in the game by replacing Cast On Use with Constant Effect variants. But with discretion and rebalancing some unique enchants. For people like me who find juggling cast-on-use enchantments irritating rather than fun.  
* [**Enchant Capacity Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48742) by Necrolesian  
Adjusts the enchant capacities of weapons, armor and clothing for balance and consistency. An MWSE version and a plugin version are included.

# Combat
* [**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord  
Takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.
* [**Defensive Stance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46845) by Merlord  
Crouching with a shield equipped increases your block and reduces your speed.
* [**Reactive Resistance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48373) by JaceyS  
Creatures and NPCs affected by a disabling magic effect (like Paralyze) will gain a temporary immunity after a configurable period of time.

# Crafts
* [**Realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673) by Merlord  
Realistic Repair overhauls the repair mechanic, by making it so that repair hammers can only be used by activating an anvil, and prongs used by activating a forge.
* [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by Mort  
Alcohol is far too common to have effects 5x that of some potions. Why even make strength potions when sujamma costs 30g and gives you +50 hulk strength? This changes that.
* [**Pickpocket**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47581) by Mort  
Rebalances pickpocketing in the sense that it makes it actually viable.
