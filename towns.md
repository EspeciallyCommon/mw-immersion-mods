# Bitter Coast
## Seyda Neen
There have been a lot of mods for Seyda Neen over the years. My recommendation is: 

[**Immersive Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44441) by DremoraLord98  

Alternates include but are not limited to [**Seyda Neen Slums**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46837?tab=posts), [**More Detailed Places Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46231), [**Seyda Neen Tree Removal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45990) for an expanded and treeless Seyda Neen, [**Lived Towns - Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46703), [**Seyda Neen Houseboat**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43364), and [**Trancemaster's New Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42234).

## Hla Oad
[**The Drop Off**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46827) by Darkry115  
Overhauls Fat Leg's Drop off to make it much more interesting - and practical as the smuggling warehouse it's meant to be. Optionally extends the Hla Oad docks and adds extra lights.  

## Gnaar Mok
[**New Gnaar Mok**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22029) by Melchior Dahrk  
A significant expansion to Gnaar Mok - makes it a bustling port town. Includes a new misc quest.

or 

[**More Detailed Places - Gnaar Mok**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/30152) by Ragox  
For a more restrained aesthetic. Adds appropriate clutter to Gnaar Mok but doesn't substantially expand Gnaar Mok.

## Vivec
These are all compatible, but whether or not you think they're aeshetically compatible (or whether your computer can handle them) are entirely different questions.

[**Shrines of the Seven Graces**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46417?tab=files) by QueenLunara  
The Shrine of Daring isn't compatible with Holidays Across Tamriel/Dramatic Vivec. I recommend getting the other six and leaving that one out.

## Balmora
Balmora has a ridiculous number of mods - it's a meme for a reason! I recommend Kilcunda's plus my interior mods (there are not quite so many interior mods as exterior mods for Balmora, so I don't feel *too* bad about the shameless plugging here). But there are plenty of alternatives if Kilcunda's isn't quite to your taste.
