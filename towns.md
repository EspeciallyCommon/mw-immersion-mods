# Bitter Coast
## Seyda Neen
There have been a lot of mods for Seyda Neen over the years. My recommendation is: 

[**Immersive Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44441) by DremoraLord98  

Alternates include but are not limited to [**Seyda Neen Slums**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46837?tab=posts), [**More Detailed Places Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46231), [**Seyda Neen Tree Removal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45990) for an expanded and treeless Seyda Neen, [**Lived Towns - Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46703), [**Seyda Neen Houseboat**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43364), and [**Trancemaster's New Seyda Neen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42234).

## Hla Oad
[**The Drop Off**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46827) by Darkry115  
Overhauls Fat Leg's Drop off to make it much more interesting - and practical as the smuggling warehouse it's meant to be. Optionally extends the Hla Oad docks and adds extra lights.  

## Gnaar Mok
[**New Gnaar Mok**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22029) by Melchior Dahrk  
A significant expansion to Gnaar Mok - makes it a bustling port town. Includes a new misc quest.

or 

[**More Detailed Places - Gnaar Mok**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/30152) by Ragox  
For a more restrained aesthetic. Adds appropriate clutter to Gnaar Mok but doesn't substantially expand Gnaar Mok.

[**Docks of Suran**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44853) by Vallylilly  

## Vivec
These are all compatible, but whether or not you think they're aeshetically compatible (or whether your computer can handle them) are entirely different questions.  

[**Dramatic Vivec**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43385) by LondonRook

[**Shrines of the Seven Graces**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46417?tab=files) by QueenLunara  
The Shrine of Daring isn't compatible with Holidays Across Tamriel/Dramatic Vivec. I recommend getting the other six and leaving that one out.

## Ebonheart
These two affect different parts of Ebonheart and are therefore compatible.

[**Wolverine Hall Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46672) by Mort  
Have you ever thought that Wolverine Hall must have been designed by Sheogorath, specifically to frustrate you? So did mort. So he fixed it (and gave the mages some beds while he was at it.)

# Grazelands
## Tel Vos
You would think that Tower of Tel Vos and Tel Vos Castle conflict, but as far as I can tell they don't. Lucky us!
