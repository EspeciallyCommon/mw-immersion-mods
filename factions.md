# Faction Mod List  
**Updated**: 2019/06/08
This list doesn't attempt to be comprehensive (there have been a *lot* of mods made for these factions over the years). I'd call it semi-curated - I can't personally vouch for every mod here, but I won't include a mod I know to be broken or of poor quality.  

Descriptions are generally the mod author's (taken straight from the mod page) - my additions are marked as such:  
__*Lucevar's Note*__

# Dunmer Great Houses & Temple
## Great House Hlaalu
[**Roleplay Options for House Hlaalu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45208?tab=posts) by Caeris & Luj1  
Have you ever wanted to arrest the murderer of Ralen Hlaalo instead of killing him?  Well now you can. This mod adds several new ways of completing persuasion quests and such for Great House Hlaalu.

[**Hlaalu Business**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39698) by Lodur9000  
Hlaalu Business adds six more quests to the game, three to Dram Bero and three to Nevena Ules, who are both members of the House Hlaalu Council. The player must hold Kinsman rank or higher in House Hlaalu to do business with these people. The quests don't give any Faction Reputation points so they don't affect your promotions through House Hlaalu. Rewards are sometimes generous, but in line with what the vanilla Hlaalu quests give you.

[**Portrait of Crassius Curio**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42812) by Aralin  
Simply adds a magnificent portrait to decorate the Curio manor and delight its dinner guests. Now there's some proof that Councilor Curio is such the patron of the arts he's made out to be.  
__*Lucevar's Note*__: Why have I listed it under quests and dialogue, I hear you ask? Well, just look at that magnificent portrait. Does he not speak to you? Will your game feel right until you complete your quest to own this portrait?

[**Resplendent Rethan - Jewel of the Odai**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47281) by Team Azturnal    
Rethan expansion mod focused on expanding and improving the settlement itself. Adds 6 additional buildings, and completely redesigns the Manor itself. The Odai Plateau has been re-landscaped and expanded to make room for the larger settlement, it's now a beautiful location, as well as a convenient one. Enjoy the spectacular view from your Hlaalu Stronghold overlooking lovely waterfalls and a scenic river. Also adds a road connecting Rethan Manor to Hla Oad, and raises the bridge that was blocking the mouth of the Odai, opening the way to the sea for skiffs and rowboats. There is also a lovely new dock offering boat service to several towns. There are several new NPCs with unique dialogue who offer various services as well.

[**Rethan Estate**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47422) by Qirin Domean  
An extension to the Hlaalu Stronghold questline, giving the player the possibility to exploit the Vassir-Didanat and Shurdan-Raplay mines and generate a weekly income depending on the player's actions and choices. Rethan Manor changes optional.  

[**Crassius and Therana Companion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44247) by PrincessStomper  
Inspired by Jasons073's April Fool's joke, this mod makes Crassius Curio and Mistress Therana into romanceable companions. Find Crassius and Therana in their usual locations - you can recruit them when you are Nerevarine (to avoid interference with main quest). Obviously you cannot recruit Therana if you have killed her! Contains mild innuendo.  
__*Lucevar's Note*__: These are fairly limited in scope - they're not full-fledged companions in the style of Julan or anything like that. But how could I leave them off a list like this? Surprisingly PG-13 for a mod that contains Crassius Curio.

[**Olyn Hleran: A Redoran Companion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45197) by Team Mythic Beasts  
__*Lucevar's Note*__: Diverges from the vanilla aesthetic in some places (see the mod page: the screenshots are fairly representative of what I mean). Mod was created for MMM2017 and may have some rough edges.
